.SH DESCRIPTION
This document describes ff version 0.3.0.

.B ff
is a simple binary file scanner that is very similar to and inspired by the UNIX/BSD file(1) utility and is mostly aimed for binary formats.

It works by scanning an internal switch case (against signatures) in order: 4-bytes, 3-bytes, 2-bytes, then offsets.

If ff can't find the file format could not be found, it reports

to stdout and returns 0.
